This is an android app designed to work in conjunction with the nomads rails app.  The rails app is running at http://nomad.heroku.com, and this app currently has that URL hardcoded into it.  As things progress, I'll make that a configurable setting.  

I have big plans, which include, but are not limited to: 
  * Create a local db to everything in, including
    * Recent activity
    * Suggestions
    * Comments
    * Blog Posts
  * Make a suggestion browser that shows (or sorts) them based on proximity 
  * Make suggestions link to google maps automagically, with navigation and all those goodies
  * Make a viewer for posts and comments
  * Figure out how to handle openid login
  * Make UI for writing (and saving drafts of)
    * Blog Posts
    * Comments
    * Suggestions
  * Make a sync layer that knows how to post things once the network is available

Obviously, this probably won't all happen, since I'm busy trying to go on a bike trip, but it's fun to dream, and it would all be super handy.
